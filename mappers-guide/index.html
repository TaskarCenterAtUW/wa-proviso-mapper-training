</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Feature Details and Placement Instructions</strong></h2>
<p>There are three primary feature types to focus on: pedestrian crossings, curb nodes, and sidewalks. While many of these features have already been generated by the Prophet AI, they might not be accurately aligned and may require adjustment.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/c55b8e194c1583d.png"></p>
<p>In the image, curbs are highlighted with black circles, footpaths/links are shown in purple, crossings are marked in red, and sidewalks are indicated in green.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Pedestrian Crossings</strong></h2>
<p>Pedestrian crossings define the path a pedestrian can take to cross a street, playing a crucial role in connecting the pedestrian network across streets. Here are the key guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path Description</strong>: Crossings indicate where pedestrians can cross streets.</li>
<li><strong>Representation</strong>: In OpenStreetMap, crossings are represented as lines (ways).</li>
<li><strong>Placement</strong>: Crossings should be drawn only on the street surfaces and not on top of sidewalks.</li>
<li><strong>Start and End Points</strong>: Each crossing must start and end with curb nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Crossings should be tagged with highway=footway and footway=crossing. These tags will be automatically added when you search for and select the ID preset ‘Pedestrian Crossing&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7abf37da0ea20855.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Curbs</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tagging Curb Nodes</strong>: Curb nodes (points) should be tagged as barrier=kerb. This tag will be automatically added when you search for and select the ID preset ‘Curb&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Tagging for Crossings</strong>: Curb nodes that connect to a crossing should also be tagged according to their type:</li>
<li>kerb=raised</li>
<li>kerb=lowered</li>
<li>kerb=flush</li>
<li>kerb=unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>These ID presets (Raised Curb, Lowered Curb) are searchable in the Feature panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation and Analysis</strong>: The appropriate curb type should be determined through on-location observation or detailed analysis of street-side imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting to Sidewalks</strong>: Refer to the further notes below for guidance on how curb nodes should be connected to sidewalks</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d7d49f6ea0e02ebb.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Sidewalks</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sidewalks are paths dedicated to pedestrians, running alongside streets.</li>
<li><strong>Drawing</strong>: Sidewalks should be drawn down the center of the sidewalk path.</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Sidewalk tags can be added by selecting a feature and searching for the ID preset ‘Sidewalk&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
<li><strong>Connection to Crossings and Curbs</strong>: Sidewalks should not be directly connected to crossings or curbs associated with crossings. Instead, use a &#34;link&#34; (described in the next section) to connect them.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Connections</strong>: If a crossing is mapped as connected to the sidewalk without curb information:</li>
<li>Split the line at the edge of the street.</li>
<li>Add the Lowered Curb/Raised Curb ID presets.</li>
<li>The resulting line connecting the curb to the sidewalk can be left as a sidewalk or tagged as the ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/5b76eb2a55d03e2a.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Links</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Links represent connections between pedestrian and non-pedestrian spaces that are not defined by any specific path. They are used to connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings, representing implied pathways.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong>: Links should connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings.</li>
<li><strong>Node Requirements</strong>: Each link should have a curb node at one end (shared with the crossing) and a node without curb tags at the other end (shared with the sidewalk).</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Links should be tagged as plain footways (highway=footway). They can also be tagged using the ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d033c8da0091ecb9.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Using Street View Imagery</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Imagery Source</strong>: We recommend using Bing Aerial satellite background images as the base for your mapping choices.</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary Imagery</strong>: To enhance your mapping decisions, you can also use Mapillary and Karta View for street-side images.</li>
<li><strong>Determining Details</strong>: Use street view options to ascertain how sidewalks pass under foliage and whether curb nodes are lowered or not.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong>: Mapillary and Bing Streetside can be activated in the main panel&#39;s toolbar. Navigate to the ‘map&#39; icon and then select ‘photo overlays&#39;.</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Examples of workflow" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Example 1</strong></h2>
<p>The image below shows a raw, unvalidated prediction on a corner curb. Note the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The curb points do not align with the actual infrastructure and are incorrectly placed in the street.</li>
<li>The curbs are labeled as raised, despite street view imagery indicating otherwise.</li>
<li>The sidewalks are not drawn down the center of the actual sidewalks.</li>
<li>The crossings do not align with the actual crossing markings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 589.50px" src="img/3cf6258b57ab13af.png"></p>
<p>This is the same area, but corrected. In the updated image:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sidewalks are properly aligned down the center of the actual sidewalks.</li>
<li>The curbs are correctly positioned and denoted as lowered curbs, based on street view imagery.</li>
<li>The crossings are accurately placed to align with the actual crossing markings.</li>
<li>Links are used to join the center lines of the sidewalks with the curbs, ensuring proper connectivity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/30d7853924a6d224.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Example 2</strong></h2>
<p>Here is another example of an incorrect prediction. Note the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The horizontal crossings are not actual places to cross.</li>
<li>Some crossings are unmarked and improperly cross large roads, which is unsuitable for pedestrian safety.</li>
<li>There are extra, unnecessary feature points that dangle without purpose. (What is that limit, btw)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to modify existing features rather than adding new ones, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the mapping.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/2b709038281fac7c.png"></p>
<p>Now the features have been edited. The incorrectly marked crossings have been removed, and the nodes on the right-hand sidewalk have been adjusted to accurately fit the infrastructure. Additionally, the extra, unnecessary points have been deleted, ensuring a cleaner and more accurate map.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/34f848b99cab98a8.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Example 3</strong></h2>
<p>Here is another example of an incorrect prediction. Note the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The crossings do not align with the actual crossing markings.</li>
<li>Curbs are improperly marked in the middle of large roads, which is unsuitable for pedestrian safety.</li>
<li>Sidewalks are directly connected to crossings or curbs.The link between curb and sidewalk is missing. Remember to modify existing features rather than adding new ones, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the mapping.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/e1e9adebeeb04b3c.png"></p>
<p>Now the features have been edited. The crossings now align with the actual crossing markings. Curbs are now properly placed at the edges of roads, ensuring pedestrian safety. Sidewalks are correctly connected to crossings or curbs with links, ensuring accurate representation. <img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/eef63570179f242b.png"></p>

<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Short description</strong></h3>
<p>Help us validate Prophet V2 predictions around the NAME Health Through Housing Locations as part of the #OpenSidewalks #HealthThroughHousing #TCAT project.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>The<a href="https://opensidewalks.com" target="_blank">OpenSidewalks</a> project, led by the<a href="https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Taskar Center for Accessible Technology</a> at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, invites you to join our efforts in collecting pedestrian network data. Using open-source tools, we document features of the built environment that impact accessibility, helping to design solutions that enhance our collective human experience.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Per Task Instructions</strong></h3>
<p>Please correct predictions for the task area by moving the features and re-tagging them as</p>
<p>necessary. See the full instructions for details.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Detailed Task Instructions</strong></h3>
<p>There are 3 feature types to be concerned with. These are pedestrian crossings, curb nodes,</p>
<p>and sidewalks. Many of these features have already been created by the Prophet AI, but they</p>
<p>may not be properly aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for Mapping Pedestrian Crossings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Crossings describe the path a pedestrian can take to cross a street, essential for connecting the pedestrian network.</li>
<li><strong>Representation</strong>: In OpenStreetMap, crossings are lines (ways).</li>
<li><strong>Placement</strong>: Draw crossings only on street surfaces, not on sidewalks.</li>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong>: Crossings should always start and end with curb nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Use the tags highway=footway, footway=crossing. These will be automatically added by selecting the ID preset ‘Pedestrian Crossing&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for Mapping Pedestrian Curbs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Curb nodes (points) should be tagged as barrier=kerb. This tag will be added automatically by selecting the ID preset ‘Curb&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: Curb nodes connecting to a crossing should be tagged according to their type (kerb=raised/lowered/flush/unknown). These presets are searchable in the Feature panel.</li>
<li><strong>Observation</strong>: Determine the appropriate curb type through location observation or analysis of street-side imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong>: See further notes below on how curb nodes should be connected to sidewalks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for Mapping Sidewalks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Sidewalks describe paths next to and along streets dedicated to pedestrians.</li>
<li><strong>Drawing</strong>: Sidewalks should be drawn down the center of the sidewalk path.</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Add sidewalk tags by selecting a feature and searching for the ID preset ‘Sidewalk&#39; in the Feature panel.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong>: Sidewalks should not directly connect to crossings or curbs associated with crossings. Instead, use a &#34;link&#34; to connect them.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Connections</strong>: If a crossing is mapped as connected to the sidewalk without curb information, split the line at the street edge, then add the Lowered Curb/Raised Curb ID presets. The resulting line can be tagged as a sidewalk or ‘Foot Path&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for Mapping Links</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Links describe connections between pedestrian and non-pedestrian spaces that are not well-defined by any identifiable path. They connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong>: Links should connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings, with a curb node at one end (shared with the crossing) and a node without curb tags at the other (shared with the sidewalk).</li>
<li><strong>Tagging</strong>: Links should be tagged as plain footways (highway=footway). They can also be tagged using the ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Street View Imagery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Source</strong>: Base your mapping choices on Bing Aerial satellite background images.</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary Sources</strong>: Use Mapillary and Karta View for street-side images to inform your decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>: Use street view options to determine how sidewalks pass under foliage and if curb nodes are lowered.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong>: Turn on Mapillary and Bing Streetside in the main panel&#39;s toolbar under the ‘map&#39; icon and ‘photo overlays&#39;.</li>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/82fcd1954c7f9608.png"></p>
<p>In the above picture, there are two issues:</p>
<p>1. The curb node on the right should be plush with the curb, and</p>
<p>2. Move the curb node to the center of the crosswalk so the crossing is more or less in the</p>
<p>center of the crosswalk</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/4b9b4298395f7af6.png"></p>
<p>In the above picture,</p>
<p>1. The sidewalk on the right should be in the middle of the sidewalk. Mapper should adjust</p>
<p>the linestring to be in the middle of the sidewalk. While doing so, the ‘links&#39; need to be</p>
<p>adjusted as well</p>
<p>2. Curb nodes should be right at the edge of the curbs, not in the middle of the road or the</p>
<p>Sidewalks.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 563.00px" src="img/b2cdc9a5c04cc8ce.png"></p>
<p>The curb nodes need to be plush with the curb, right now they are more on the sidewalks</p>

<p><strong>The biggest mistake in the above diagram is the pedestrian crossings that are mentioned</strong></p>
<p><strong>horizontally. As you can see, this is a VERY dangerous place to cross the road. Just</strong></p>
<p><strong>because there are curbs doesn&#39;t mean there should be a crossing. These crossings were</strong></p>
<p><strong>added by the mappers, which shouldn&#39;t have been added.</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 318.00px" src="img/15444a41d83fcefa.png"></p>
<p>Curb nodes need to be placed better in the above diagram </p>
