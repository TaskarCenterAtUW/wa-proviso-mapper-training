        <p>This will open the Tasking Manager Editor window. The left hand Feature panel shows the</p>
<p>details of a selected feature. You can use the search bar to search for the correct feature</p>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/f5ea0e0f92dab956.png"></p>
<p>The toolbar(in purple) along the right edge of the Map panel contains helpful options.</p>

<p>other features outside of this use case)</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Feature details and proper placement instructions</strong></h2>
<p>There are 3 feature types to be concerned with. These are pedestrian crossings, curb nodes,</p>
<p>and sidewalks. Many of these features have already been created by the Prophet AI, but they</p>
<p>may not be properly aligned.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/c55b8e194c1583d.png"></p>
<p>In this picture, curbs are highlighted with black circles. Footpaths/links are in purple, crossings in red, and sidewalks in green.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Pedestrian Crossings</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Crossings describe the path a pedestrian can take to cross a street. These are essential</li>
</ul>
<p>for connecting the pedestrian network across streets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossings are lines (ways in OpenStreetMap).</li>
<li>Crossings are drawn only on the surface of streets; they should not be drawn on top of</li>
</ul>
<p>sidewalks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossings should always start and end with curb nodes.</li>
<li>Crossings are always tagged with &#34;highway=footway, footway=crossing&#34;. These tags will</li>
</ul>
<p>be added automatically by searching for and selecting the ID preset ‘Pedestrian</p>
<p>Crossing&#39; in the Feature panel.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7abf37da0ea20855.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Curbs</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Curb nodes (points) should be tagged as &#34;barrier=kerb&#34;. This tag will be added</li>
</ul>
<p>automatically by searching for and selecting the ID preset ‘Curb&#39; in the Feature panel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Curb nodes (points) connecting to a crossing should also be tagged according to their</li>
</ul>
<p>type:</p>
<p>○ kerb=raised/lowered/flush/unknown</p>
<p>○ These ID presets are searchable in the Feature panel (Raised Curb, Lowered</p>
<p>Curb)</p>
<p>○ This denotation should be done after observation on location or by considerable</p>
<p>analysis of streetside imagery</p>
<ul>
<li>See further notes below on how curb nodes (points) should be connected to sidewalks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d7d49f6ea0e02ebb.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Sidewalks</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sidewalks describe paths next to and along streets that are dedicated to pedestrians.</li>
<li>Sidewalks are drawn down the center of the sidewalk path.</li>
<li>Sidewalk tags can be added by selecting a feature and searching for ID preset</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Sidewalk&#39; in the Feature panel</p>
<ul>
<li>Sidewalks should not be directly connected to crossings or curbs associated with</li>
</ul>
<p>crossings. Instead, a &#34;link&#34; (described in the next section) should connect them.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a crossing is mapped as connected to the sidewalk, without curb information, please</li>
</ul>
<p>split the line at the edge of the street, then add the Lowered Curb/Raised Curb ID</p>
<p>presets. The resulting line that connects the curb to the sidewalk can be left as a</p>
<p>sidewalk, or it should be tagged as ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/5b76eb2a55d03e2a.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Rules For Mapping Links</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Links describe connections between pedestrian and non-pedestrian spaces that are not</li>
</ul>
<p>well-described by any identifiable path. In our case, we use links to connect sidewalk</p>
<p>centerlines to crossings, as this path is not geometrically delineated in any way, but</p>
<p>implied.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links should connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings.</li>
<li>Links should have a curb node at one end (shared with the crossing) and a node without</li>
</ul>
<p>curb tags at the other (shared with the sidewalk).</p>
<ul>
<li>Links should be tagged as plain footways (highway=footway) for now. They can be</li>
</ul>
<p>tagged using the ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d033c8da0091ecb9.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Using Street View Imagery</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We advise that you base your mapping choices on Bing Aerial satellite background</li>
</ul>
<p>images. You can also use Mapillary and Karta View to access street-side images to help</p>
<p>inform your mapping decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use street view options to determine how sidewalks pass under foliage, and if curb</li>
</ul>
<p>nodes are lowered or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapillary and Bing Streetside can be turned on in the main panel&#39;s toolbar, under the</li>
</ul>
<p>‘map&#39; icon, then under ‘photo overlays&#39;</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Examples of workflow" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Example 1</strong></h2>
<p>The image below is a raw, unvalidated prediction on a corner curb. Note that the curb points do</p>
<p>not align with the infrastructure and are instead in the street. The curbs are also labeled as</p>
<p>raised when street view indicates otherwise. The sidewalks do not go down the center of the</p>
<p>actual sidewalks, and the crossings do not align with crossing markings.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/3cf6258b57ab13af.png"></p>
<p>This is the same area, but corrected. The sidewalks are aligned, the curbs are on the curbs, and</p>
<p>are denoted as lowered curbs. The crossings are correctly placed, and links join the center lines</p>
<p>of the sidewalks with the curbs.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/30d7853924a6d224.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Example 2</strong></h2>
<p>Here is another example of an incorrect prediction. See that the horizontal crossings are not</p>
<p>actual places to cross. Some crossings are unmarked and cross roads, but this road is too large</p>
<p>for this. (What is that limit, btw) There are also extra dangling feature points. Remember to just</p>
<p>modify existing features, not add new ones</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/2b709038281fac7c.png"></p>
<p>Now the features have been edited. The incorrectly marked crossings are gone and the nodes</p>
<p>on the right hand sidewalk have been moved to fit the infrastructure. Extra points have been</p>
<p>deleted.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/34f848b99cab98a8.png"></p>

<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Per Task Instructions</strong></h3>
<p>Please correct predictions for the task area by moving the features and re-tagging them as</p>

<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Detailed Task Instructions</strong></h3>
<p>There are 3 feature types to be concerned with. These are pedestrian crossings, curb nodes,</p>
<p>and sidewalks. Many of these features have already been created by the Prophet AI, but they</p>
<p>may not be properly aligned.</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; Rules For Mapping Pedestrian Crossings&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crossings describe the path a pedestrian can take to cross a street. These are essential</p>
<p>for connecting the pedestrian network across streets.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Crossings are lines (ways in OpenStreetMap).&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Crossings are drawn only on the surface of streets; they should not be drawn on top of</p>
<p>sidewalks.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Crossings should always start and end with curb nodes.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Crossings are always tagged with &#34;highway=footway, footway=crossing&#34;. These tags will be</p>
<p>added automatically by searching for and selecting the ID preset ‘Pedestrian Crossing&#39; in the</p>
<p>Feature panel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; Rules For Mapping Curbs&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curb nodes (points) should be tagged as &#34;barrier=kerb&#34;. This tag will be added</p>
<p>automatically by searching for and selecting the ID preset ‘Curb&#39; in the Feature panel.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Curb nodes (points) connecting to a crossing should also be tagged according to their</p>
<p>type:&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;kerb=raised/lowered/flush/unknown</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;These ID presets are again, searchable in the left hand panel (Raised Curb, Lowered</p>
<p>Curb)&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;This denotation should be done after observation on location or by considerable analysis of</p>
<p>streetside imagery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;See further notes below on how curb nodes (points) should be connected to</p>
<p>sidewalks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; Rules For Mapping Sidewalks&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidewalks describe paths next to and along streets that are dedicated to pedestrians.</p>
<p>&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Sidewalks are drawn down the center of the sidewalk path.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Sidewalk tags can be added by selecting a feature and searching for ID preset ‘Sidewalk&#39; in</p>
<p>the Feature panel.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Sidewalks should not be directly connected to crossings or curbs associated with crossings.</p>
<p>Instead, a &#34;link&#34; (described in the next section) should connect them.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;If a crossing is mapped as connected to the sidewalk, without curb information, please split</p>
<p>the line at the edge of the street, then add the Lowered Curb/Raised Curb ID presets. The</p>
<p>resulting line that connects the curb to the sidewalk can be left as a sidewalk, or it should be</p>
<p>tagged as ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; Rules For Mapping Links&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Links describe connections between pedestrian spaces and connections between</p>
<p>pedestrian and non-pedestrian spaces that are not well-described by any identifiable path.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;In our case, we use links to connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings, as this path is not</p>
<p>geometrically delineated in any way, but implied.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Links should connect sidewalk centerlines to crossings&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Links should have a curb node at one end (shared with the crossing) and a node without</p>
<p>curb tags at the other (shared with the sidewalk)&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;Links should be tagged as plain footways (highway=footway) for now. They can be tagged</p>
<p>using the ID preset ‘Foot Path&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt; Using Street View Imagery&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We advise that you base your mapping choices on Bing Aerial satellite background</p>
<p>images. &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;You can also use Mapillary and Karta View to access street side images to help inform your</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Submit your questions here" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>How to submit a question</strong></h2>
<p>1. Take a screenshot of the image / area in question, and paste it here. Add the weblink</p>
<p>you see when you have that area up in the iD editor, like this:</p>
<p>https://workspaces-tasks.sidewalks.washington.edu/projects/19/map/?editor=ID#backgro</p>
<p>und=King_WA_2021&amp;id=w-3&amp;map=20.00/47.31672/-122.31859</p>
<p>2. Describe in words the issue you are facing. The more information you provide the better</p>
<p>it is for us to figure out how to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Additional Issues identified</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/82fcd1954c7f9608.png"></p>
<p>In the above picture, there are two issues:</p>
<p>1. The curb node on the right should be plush with the curb, and</p>
<p>2. Move the curb node to the center of the crosswalk so the crossing is more or less in the</p>
<p>center of the crosswalk</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/4b9b4298395f7af6.png"></p>
<p>In the above picture,</p>
<p>1. The sidewalk on the right should be in the middle of the sidewalk. Mapper should adjust</p>
<p>the linestring to be in the middle of the sidewalk. While doing so, the ‘links&#39; need to be</p>
<p>adjusted as well</p>
<p>2. Curb nodes should be right at the edge of the curbs, not in the middle of the road or the</p>
<p>Sidewalks.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 563.00px" src="img/b2cdc9a5c04cc8ce.png"></p>
<p>The curb nodes need to be plush with the curb, right now they are more on the sidewalks</p>

<p><strong>The biggest mistake in the above diagram is the pedestrian crossings that are mentioned</strong></p>
<p><strong>horizontally. As you can see, this is a VERY dangerous place to cross the road. Just</strong></p>
<p><strong>because there are curbs doesn&#39;t mean there should be a crossing. These crossings were</strong></p>
<p><strong>added by the mappers, which shouldn&#39;t have been added.</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 318.00px" src="img/15444a41d83fcefa.png"></p>
<p>Curb nodes need to be placed better in the above diagram </p>
